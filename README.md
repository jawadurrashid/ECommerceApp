# Simple - E-Commerce Application

Simple is a full-stack E-Commerce application that will sell some of the internet's hottest trending products. The project was made using Javascript in the front-end, Node.JS with a MongoDB database in the backend, EJS templating for views as well as Express middleware for request processing and routing. I implemented the user authentication and profile infrastructure using Node.Js and Mongoose to map a native user schema to a MongoDB database. Stripe and Elasticsearch libraries will soon be implemented for product checkout and search functionalities. For now, data will be generated using Faker.js.
