# Simple - E-Commerce Application

Simple is a full-stack E-Commerce application that will sell some of the internet's hottest trending products. The project was made using Javascript in both the front and back-end, Node.JS with a MongoDB database in the backend, EJS templating for views as well as Express middleware for request processing and routing. Stripe and Elasticsearch libraries will soon be implmented for product checkout and search functionality. For now, data will be made using Faker.js.
